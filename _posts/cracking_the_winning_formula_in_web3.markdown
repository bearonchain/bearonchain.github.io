You ever feel like just when you finally figure out how things work, the whole game changes? Yeah, that’s Web3 in a nutshell. What worked last cycle? Doesn’t matter. The formula resets. Every. Single. Time.

Success in this space is like Proof of Work mining, whoever gets the new formula first wins. Everyone else? Stuck solving yesterday’s problems. If you’re applying last season’s alpha, congrats, you’re already behind.

## The Developer’s Plight: Bull vs. Bear Markets

’ve been through both sides of the market, and let me tell you being a dev in a bull run feels like running a sprint with a jetpack. Money’s flying, VCs are throwing cash at anything with a whitepaper, and the biggest problem is keeping up. You don’t even need to be good,  just be there and shipping something remotely related to the hype.

Then comes the bear market. The jetpack malfunctions, the floor disappears, and suddenly it’s survival mode. The projects that thrived on speculation alone? Gone. The real ones? They keep building. It’s in the bear market where the next giants are born. The trick is not getting wiped out before you get there.

## How to Grasp a Trend ASAP
The worst feeling? Seeing a trend too late. It’s like showing up to a party when the drinks are empty and the DJ already left. I’ve been there, and it sucks. So, how do you spot the next wave before everyone else?

First, follow the builders, not the noise. VCs and influencers talk, but devs ship. When you start seeing multiple projects quietly iterating on a similar concept, pay attention. That’s where the action is. Second, watch user behavior. Where are people spending time? What’s solving real problems? If something feels inevitable, it probably is. And third, join the right communities. The real alpha of crypto lies in Twitter,  Discords, dev chats, and Telegram groups where people are actually building,

Gone are the days when your GitHub alone was enough to get you hired. Now, projects look at your Twitter too. Your code proves your skill, but your online presence shows your mindshare. Build it, or get left behind.

The Current Web3 Trend
Right now, the hottest narrative is Web3 + AI. And this isn’t just another hype cycle, it’s solving real problems. We’re talking decentralized compute, decentralized AI agents, and decentralized data systems. Imagine AI models that aren’t controlled by a single entity but instead run on decentralized networks. That’s where things are headed.
Some names to watch? @opentensor, @hyperbolic_labs , @OpenledgerHQ , @PrimeIntellect , @SentientAGI . These are pushing the limits of what’s possible in decentralized AI. If you’re trying to position yourself for the next wave, this is where you should be looking.
And if you’re wondering what the closest narrative to this is it’s DePIN. Decentralized physical infrastructure networks. If you understand that movement, you’ll see why decentralized AI fits right in.
Oh, and as always, scaling EVM is still a thing. Projects like @megaeth_labs  and @monad_xyz  are working on new ways to optimize execution and make Ethereum faster. Some trends come and go, but making Ethereum scale? That’s a forever narrative.

The Formula That Always Works
Even though the success formula changes every cycle, one thing stays constant:

```
Best UX +  Current Trend + Best Community Management = WinningFormula
```
You need killer UX because if people can’t use your product, they won’t. You need to be in the right trend because no matter how good your tech is, if you’re building for a dead market, no one cares. And most importantly, community matters. The biggest projects in Web3 thrive on engaged, passionate users. Build for them, and you win.
Kaito and Mindshare: The Key to Staying Relevant
One simple way to notice the trends and to get noticed is @KaitoAI 

With the advent of AI tools, a web3 dev can write technical blogs and deep dives by using them by carefully crafting their masterpiece.
Kaito (and tools like it) exist for one reason: information arbitrage. The sooner you figure out what’s next, the better positioned you are. 

In Web3, speed kills. The ones who relearn the fastest, win the most.
So if you’re out here trying to make it, forget the idea of a permanent formula. Just keep learning, keep adapting, and stay ahead of the curve.

There is far more creativity involved when you generate articles from AI than when you actually write. So avoid checking whether it's generated by AI and just enjoy reading.
