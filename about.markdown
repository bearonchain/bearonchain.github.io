## Hey there, I’m @bearonchain 👋

I talk and write about the wild crossroads of **AI and Crypto**, not because it's trendy, but because I believe it's essential.  
The future isn’t just human or machine. It's both. And I’m here trying to figure that out, out loud.

### Backstory

Ever since I was in college, **blockchain** was my favourite battleground.  
Then came **AI**, which felt like a replacement at first  but slowly I saw the synergy. And I decided not to pick one, but to **merge their strengths**.

Today, I'm a **developer turned researcher** in Web3 and AI.  
I do a bit of everything. And people value me for my **creative ideas and problem-solving**.

I'm not the best coder, but I get the job done with precision.  
Yes, I can code without AI, vibe code, ship prototypes, write vision decks, or even switch to full-on business mode when needed.  
One day I might be coding all day.  
Another, I could be writing blogs.  
Or spending the entire day in meetings crafting new product strategies.  
I don’t restrict myself to one box, one tag, or one title.

### How I work

- I love taking the stage.  
- I get bored with background jobs.  
- I prioritise **my growth** just as much as the brand's growth.  
- I jump ships without hesitation if there's no personal growth.  
- I don’t work under **slave mentality** for money.  
- I chase **challenges**, not just salary.  
- But that doesn’t mean you can hire me for pennies. I charge a lot  because I deliver.

### Who I really am

I’m a solid thinker.  
Sometimes highly optimistic.  
Sometimes highly pessimistic.  
It depends on how you handle me.

But I’m human.  
I make mistakes.  
And I never shy away from owning them.

Feed me with **attention, money, and meaningful challenges**, and I’ll create wonders.  
If not, I won’t even consider working.

If you find this blog offensive, I’m sorry. But I need to be **frank about myself**.  
I’ve suffered enough hiding my emotions to please people.

And here's the thing  if you're working in the decentralised world and AI, and you **still can't be transparent**, that’s not just a red flag  that’s a contradiction.

### What do I work on?

- 🧠 Building AI agents that think, reason, and maybe even vibe  
- 🪙 Exploring tokenisation, attribution, and new forms of AI data economies  
- ⚙️ Writing about humanoid robots and why they matter more than your next phone  
- 🧩 Dreaming up protocols that merge **human intelligence with synthetic minds**

---

### Stuff I believe in

- **Decentralised AI** is not optional. It’s necessary.  
- **Synthetic data** is the new oil  with memory.  
- AI won’t replace humans. **Humans who use AI will.**  
- Humanoids aren't tools. They’re the next big philosophical debate.
